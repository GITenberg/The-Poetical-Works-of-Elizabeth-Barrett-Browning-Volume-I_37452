<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>In a recent "Memoir of Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"
by John H. Ingram, it is observed that "such essays on
her personal history as have appeared, either in England
or elsewhere, are replete with mistakes or misstatements."
For these he proposes to substitute "a correct if short
memoir:" but, kindly and appreciative as may be Mr.
Ingram's performance, there occur not a few passages in
it equally "mistaken and misstated."</p>

<p>1. "Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Edward
Moulton Barrett, was born in London on the 4th of
March, 1809." Elizabeth was born, March 6, 1806, at
Coxhoe Hall, county of Durham, the residence of her
father.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> "Before she was eleven she composed an epic
on 'Marathon.'" She was then fourteen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<p>2. "It is said that Mr. Barrett was a man of intellect
and culture, and therefore able to direct his daughter's
education, but be that so or not, he obtained for her
the tutorial assistance of the well-known Greek scholar
Hugh Stuart Boyd ... who was also a writer of fluent
verse: and his influence and instruction doubtless confirmed
Miss Barrett in her poetical aspirations." Mr.
Boyd, early deprived of sight from over-study, resided
at Malvern, and cared for little else than Greek literature,
especially that of the "Fathers." He was about or over
fifty, stooped a good deal, and was nearly bald. His
daily habit was to sit for hours before a table, treating
it as a piano with his fingers, and reciting Greek&mdash;his
memory for which was such that, on a folio column of
his favourite St. Gregory being read to him, he would
repeat it without missing a syllable. Elizabeth, then
residing in Herefordshire, visited him frequently, partly
from her own love of Greek, and partly from a desire
for the congenial society of one to whom her attendance
might be helpful. There was nothing in the least
"tutorial" in this relation&mdash;merely the natural feeling of
a girl for a blind and disabled scholar in whose pursuits
she took interest. Her knowledge of Greek was originally
due to a preference for sharing with her brother
Edward in the instruction of his Scottish tutor Mr.
M'Swiney rather than in that of her own governess
Mrs. Orme: and at such lessons she constantly assisted
until her brother's departure for the Charter House&mdash;where
he had Thackeray for a schoolfellow. In point
of fact, she was self-taught in almost every respect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Mr. Boyd was no writer of "fluent verse," though he
published an unimportant volume, and the literary
sympathies of the friends were exclusively bestowed on
Greek.</p>

<p>3. "Edward, the eldest of the family," was Elizabeth's
younger by nearly two years. He and his companions
perished, not "just off Teignmouth," but in Babbicombe
Bay. The bodies drifted up channel, and were recovered
three days after.</p>

<p>4. "Her father's fortune was considerably augmented
by his accession to the property of his only brother
Richard, for many years Speaker of the House of
Assembly at Jamaica." Mr. Edward Moulton, by the
will of his grandfather, was directed to affix the name
of Barrett to that of Moulton, upon succeeding to the
estates in Jamaica. Richard was his cousin, and by his
death Mr. Barrett did not acquire a shilling. His only
brother was Samuel, sometime M.P. for Richmond.
He had also a sister who died young, the full-length
portrait of whom by Sir Thomas Lawrence (the first
exhibited by that painter) is in the possession of
Octavius Moulton-Barrett at Westover, near Calbourne,
in the Isle of Wight. With respect to the "semi-tropical
taste" of Mr. Barrett, so characterised in the "Memoir,"
it may be mentioned that, on the early death of his
father, he was brought from Jamaica to England when
a very young child, as a ward of the late Chief Baron
Lord Abinger, then Mr. Scarlett, whom he frequently
accompanied in his post-chaise when on Circuit. He
was sent to Harrow, but received there so savage a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
punishment for a supposed offence ("burning the toast")
by the youth whose "fag" he had become, that he was
withdrawn from the school by his mother, and the
delinquent was expelled. At the age of sixteen he was
sent by Mr. Scarlett to Cambridge, and thence, for an
early marriage, went to Northumberland. After purchasing
the estate in Herefordshire, he gave himself
up assiduously to the usual duties and occupations of
a country gentleman,&mdash;farmed largely, was an active
magistrate, became for a year High Sheriff, and in all
county contests busied himself as a Liberal. He had a
fine taste for landscape-gardening, planted considerably,
loved trees&mdash;almost as much as his friend, the early
correspondent of his daughter, Sir Uvedale Price&mdash;and
for their sake discontinued keeping deer in the park.</p>

<p>Many other particulars concerning other people, in
other "Biographical Memoirs which have appeared in
England or elsewhere" for some years past, are similarly
"mistaken and misstated:" but they seem better left
without notice by anybody.</p>

<h2>Dedication</h2>

<h4><i>TO MY FATHER</i></h4>


<p><i>When your eyes fall upon this page of dedication, and you start to
see to whom it is inscribed, your first thought will be of the time far
off when I was a child and wrote verses, and when I dedicated them
to you who were my public and my critic. Of all that such a recollection
implies of saddest and sweetest to both of us, it would become
neither of us to speak before the world, nor would it be possible for
us to speak of it to one another, with voices that did not falter.
Enough, that what is in my heart when I write thus, will be fully
known to yours.</i></p>

<p><i>And my desire is that you, who are a witness how if this art of
poetry had been a less earnest object to me, it must have fallen from
exhausted hands before this day,&mdash;that you, who have shared with
me in things bitter and sweet, softening or enhancing them, every
day,&mdash;that you, who hold with me, over all sense of loss and transiency,
one hope by one Name,&mdash;may accept from me the inscription
of these volumes, the exponents of a few years of an existence which
has been sustained and comforted by you as well as given. Somewhat
more faint-hearted than I used to be, it is my fancy thus to
seem to return to a visible personal dependence on you, as if indeed I
were a child again; to conjure your beloved image between myself
and the public, so as to be sure of one smile,&mdash;and to satisfy my
heart while I sanctify my ambition, by associating with the great
pursuit of my life, its tenderest and holiest affection.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<h4>TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF
MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.</h4>


<p>The collection here offered to the public consists of
Poems which have been written in the interim between
the period of the publication of my "Seraphim" and the
present; variously coloured, or perhaps shadowed, by
the life of which they are the natural expression,&mdash;and,
with the exception of a few contributions to English or
American periodicals, are printed now for the first time.</p>

<p>As the first poem of this collection, the "Drama of
Exile," is the longest and most important work (to <i>me</i>!)
which I ever trusted into the current of publication, I
may be pardoned for entreating the reader's attention to
the fact, that I decided on publishing it after considerable
hesitation and doubt. The subject of the Drama
rather fastened on me than was chosen; and the form,
approaching the model of the Greek tragedy, shaped
itself under my hand, rather by force of pleasure than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
of design. But when the excitement of composition
had subsided, I felt afraid of my position. My subject
was the new and strange experience of the fallen
humanity, as it went forth from Paradise into the
wilderness; with a peculiar reference to Eve's allotted
grief, which, considering that self-sacrifice belonged to
her womanhood, and the consciousness of originating
the Fall to her offence,&mdash;appeared to me imperfectly
apprehended hitherto, and more expressible by a woman
than a man. There was room, at least, for lyrical
emotion in those first steps into the wilderness,&mdash;in that
first sense of desolation after wrath,&mdash;in that first audible
gathering of the recriminating "groan of the whole
creation,"&mdash;in that first darkening of the hills from
the recoiling feet of angels,&mdash;and in that first silence of
the voice of God. And I took pleasure in driving in,
like a pile, stroke upon stroke, the Idea of <span class="smcap">Exile</span>,&mdash;admitting
Lucifer as an extreme Adam, to represent the
ultimate tendencies of sin and loss,&mdash;that it might be
strong to bear up the contrary idea of the Heavenly love
and purity. But when all was done, I felt afraid, as I
said before, of my position. I had promised my own
prudence to shut close the gates of Eden between
Milton and myself, so that none might say I dared to
walk in his footsteps. He should be within, I thought,
with his Adam and Eve unfallen or falling,&mdash;and I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
without, with my <span class="smcap">Exiles</span>,&mdash;<i>I</i> also an exile! It would
not do. The subject, and his glory covering it, swept
through the gates, and I stood full in it, against my
will, and contrary to my vow,&mdash;till I shrank back fearing,
almost desponding; hesitating to venture even a passing
association with our great poet before the face of the
public. Whether at last I took courage for the venture,
by a sudden revival of that love of manuscript which
should be classed by moral philosophers among the
natural affections, or by the encouraging voice of a dear
friend, it is not interesting to the reader to inquire.
Neither could the fact affect the question; since I bear,
of course, my own responsibilities. For the rest, Milton
is too high, and I am too low, to render it necessary for
me to disavow any rash emulation of his divine faculty
on his own ground; while enough individuality will be
granted, I hope, to my poem, to rescue me from that
imputation of plagiarism which should be too servile a
thing for every sincere thinker. After all, and at the
worst, I have only attempted, in respect to Milton,
what the Greek dramatists achieved lawfully in respect
to Homer. They constructed dramas on Trojan
ground; they raised on the buskin and even clasped
with the sock, the feet of Homeric heroes; yet they
neither imitated their Homer nor emasculated him.
The Agamemnon of &AElig;schylus, who died in the bath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
did no harm to, nor suffered any harm from, the
Agamemnon of Homer who bearded Achilles. To this
analogy&mdash;the more favourable to me from the obvious
exception in it, that Homer's subject was his own
possibly by creation,&mdash;whereas Milton's was his own by
illustration only,&mdash;I appeal. To this analogy&mdash;<i>not</i> to
this comparison, be it understood&mdash;I appeal. For the
analogy of the stronger may apply to the weaker; and
the reader may have patience with the weakest while she
suggests the application.</p>

<p>On a graver point I must take leave to touch, in
further reference to my dramatic poem. The divine
Saviour is represented in vision towards the close,
speaking and transfigured; and it has been hinted to
me that the introduction may give offence in quarters
where I should be most reluctant to give any. A
reproach of the same class, relating to the frequent
recurrence of a Great Name in my pages, has already
filled me with regret. How shall I answer these things?
Frankly, in any case. When the old mysteries represented
the Holiest Being in a rude familiar fashion,
and the people gazed on, with the faith of children
in their earnest eyes, the critics of a succeeding age,
who rejoiced in Congreve, cried out "Profane." Yet
Andreini's mystery suggested Milton's epic; and Milton,
the most reverent of poets, doubting whether to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
his work into the epic form or the dramatic, left, on
the latter basis, a rough ground-plan, in which his intention
of introducing the "Heavenly Love" among
the persons of his drama is extant to the present day.
But the tendency of the present day is to sunder the
daily life from the spiritual creed,&mdash;to separate the worshipping
from the acting man,&mdash;and by no means to
"live by faith." There is a feeling abroad which
appears to me (I say it with deference) nearer to superstition
than to religion, that there should be no touching
of holy vessels except by consecrated fingers, nor any
naming of holy names except in consecrated places.
As if life were not a continual sacrament to man,
since Christ brake the daily bread of it in His hands!
As if the name of God did not build a church, by the
very naming of it! As if the word God were not, everywhere
in His creation, and at every moment in His
eternity, an appropriate word! As if it could be uttered
unfitly, if devoutly! I appeal on these points, which I
will not argue, from the conventions of the Christian
to his devout heart; and I beseech him generously to
believe of me that I have done that in reverence from
which, through reverence, he might have abstained; and
that where he might have been driven to silence by the
principle of adoration, I, by the very same principle, have
been hurried into speech.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>It should have been observed in another place,&mdash;the
fact, however, being sufficiently obvious throughout the
drama,&mdash;that the time is from the evening into the
night. If it should be objected that I have lengthened
my twilight too much for the East, I might hasten to
answer that we know nothing of the length of mornings
or evenings before the Flood, and that I cannot, for my
own part, believe in an Eden without the longest of
purple twilights. The evening, =erev=, of Genesis signifies a
"mingling," and approaches the meaning of our "twilight"
analytically. Apart from which considerations,
my "exiles" are surrounded, in the scene described,
by supernatural appearances; and the shadows that
approach them are not only of the night.</p>

<p>The next longest poem to the "Drama of Exile," in
the collection, is the "Vision of Poets," in which I have
endeavoured to indicate the necessary relations of genius
to suffering and self-sacrifice. In the eyes of the living
generation, the poet is at once a richer and poorer man
than he used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but speaks
no more oracles: and the evil of this social incrustation
over a great idea is eating deeper and more fatally into
our literature than either readers or writers may apprehend
fully. I have attempted to express in this poem
my view of the mission of the poet, of the self-abnegation
implied in it, of the great work involved in it, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
duty and glory of what Balzac has beautifully and truly
called "la patience ang&eacute;lique du g&eacute;nie;" and of the
obvious truth, above all, that if knowledge is power,
suffering should be acceptable as a part of knowledge.
It is enough to say of the other poems, that scarcely one
of them is unambitious of an object and a significance.</p>

<p>Since my "Seraphim" was received by the public
with more kindness than its writer had counted on, I
dare not rely on having put away the faults with which
that volume abounded and was mildly reproached.
Something indeed I may hope to have retrieved, because
some progress in mind and in art every active thinker
and honest writer must consciously or unconsciously
make, with the progress of existence and experience:
and, in some sort&mdash;since "we learn in suffering what we
teach in song,"&mdash;my songs may be fitter to teach. But
if it were not presumptuous language on the lips of one
to whom life is more than usually uncertain, my favourite
wish for this work would be, that it be received by the
public as a step in the right track, towards a future
indication of more value and acceptability. I would
fain do better,&mdash;and I feel as if I might do better: I
aspire to do better. It is no new form of the nympholepsy
of poetry, that my ideal should fly before me:&mdash;and
if I cry out too hopefully at sight of the white
vesture receding between the cypresses, let me be blamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
gently if justly. In any case, while my poems are full
of faults,&mdash;as I go forward to my critics and confess,&mdash;they
have my heart and life in them,&mdash;they are not
empty shells. If it must be said of me that I have contributed
immemorable verses to the many rejected by
the age, it cannot at least be said that I have done so in
a light and irresponsible spirit. Poetry has been as
serious a thing to me as life itself; and life has been a
very serious thing: there has been no playing at skittles
for me in either. I never mistook pleasure for the final
cause of poetry; nor leisure, for the hour of the poet.
I have done my work, so far, as work,&mdash;not as mere
hand and head work, apart from the personal being,&mdash;but
as the completest expression of that being to which
I could attain,&mdash;and as work I offer it to the public,&mdash;feeling
its shortcomings more deeply than any of my
readers, because measured from the height of my aspiration,&mdash;but
feeling also that the reverence and sincerity
with which the work was done should give it some protection
with the reverent and sincere.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>This edition, including my earlier and later writings,
I have endeavoured to render as little unworthy as
possible of the indulgence of the public. Several poems
I would willingly have withdrawn, if it were not almost
impossible to extricate what has been once caught and
involved in the machinery of the press. The alternative
is a request to the generous reader that he may use the
weakness of those earlier verses, which no subsequent
revision has succeeded in strengthening, less as a reproach
to the writer, than as a means of marking some
progress in her other attempts.</p>

<span class="i0">The next pool they came near unto<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His lips sobbed through the water rank,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At last came silence. A slow kiss<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
